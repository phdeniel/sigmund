Sigmund is a non-regression utility designed to test filesystems

WRITE THE CONFIGURATION FILE
============================

In sigmund's root directory, edit the run_test.rc file
It will look like this:

 # Used for pseudofs tests
 EXPORTDIR=/etc/ganesha
 FSAL=gpfs
 EXPORTFILE=gpfs.ganesha.exports.conf
 SERVERHOSTNAME=ganesha.domain.com
 FS_DIR=/fs0
 TEST_ROOT_DIR=/mnt/sigmund_root
 GANVERSION=2.0

 TEST_DIR=/mnt/sigmund
 BUILD_TEST_DIR=/tmp/sigmund

 ##### Variables to be used by module allfs #####
 # Path to cthon04 test's suite
 CTHON04_DIR=/opt/cthon04
 GIT_CLONE_URL=/opt/GANESHA/.git

 # Non-root user that will run part of the test
 TEST_USER=phil

 # Primary group for the TEST_USER
 GROUP1=users

 # One of the alternate group for TEST_USER
 GROUP2=ganesha

Important variables are
- TEST_USER: the user whose identity will be used to run the tests
- GROUP1: Primary group for TEST_USER
- GROUP2: one of the secondary groups (or alternate groups) for TEST_USER
- SERVERHOSTNAME: hostname or ip of the ganesha server that the local machine can ssh to for setting up tests.
- FS_DIR: Location of filesystem on the Ganesha server which is being exported as ${TEST_DIR}. This is used for creating export entries.
- TEST_ROOT_DIR: the directory where Sigmund pseudofs tests will be run. This directory must be the "/" export and must be a pseudofs node.
- TEST_DIR: the directory, inside the mount point to be tested, were Sigmund will be run. Make sure that TEST_USERcan read and write in it
- BUILD_TEST_DIR: a temporary directory where a few C programs will be generated. Make sure that TEST_USERcan read and write in it
- CTHON04_DIR: the directory where ctho04 was installed. TEST_USER must be abe to read/execute in it.
- GIT_CLONE_URL : a git repository that TEST_USERcan read (even in a read-only way). I recommend a local repo for generating a bigger stress to the filesystem


BUILD THE ANCILLARY TESTS
=========================

Build tests's program by running ./build_test.sh


RUN THE TESTS
=============

--- Behaviour ---
Sigmund is designed to be run on top of various filesystems. Each type of FS to be tested is a "behavior". 
Behavior can be easily added to Sigmund by adding a file in the behavior/ directory in Sigmund's source tree.
Currently supported behaviors currently are:
- 9p
- ext4
- lustre
- nfs
Regarding the chose behavior, some tests will be run of not. For example, xattr tests won't run on nfs but will on 9p and lustre.

--- Running the tests ---
Running the tests can do it in three way:
- running it in verbose mode : use "./sigmund.sh behavior"
- running it in verbose mode with extra JUnit report. This is designed for integration in jenkins : "./sigmund.sh behavior -j"
- running it in quiet mode : use "./sigmund.sh behavior -q"

When in quiet mode, ouput will look like this:

 # ./sigmund.sh ext4 -q
 test1m :  ALLFS: copy file with 444 mode             [  OK  ]
 test1g :  ALLFS: traverse 700 dirs with altgroups    [  OK  ]
 test2r :  ALLFS: rm -rf of wide namespace            [  OK  ]
 test3b :  ALLFS: cthon04's basic tests               [  OK  ]
 test3g :  ALLFS: cthon04's general tests             [  OK  ]
 test3s :  ALLFS: cthon04's special tests             [  OK  ]
 test3l :  ALLFS: cthon04's lock tests                [  OK  ]
 test4g :  ALLFS: git clone a local repository        [  OK  ]
 test4s :  ALLFS: Tar calls utimes on symlink         [  OK  ]
 test4r :  ALLFS: Use mmap() to read a file           [  OK  ]
 test4w :  ALLFS: Use mmap() to write a file          [  OK  ]
 test21f : XATTR: simple xattr set/get : file         [  OK  ]
 test21d : XATTR: simple xattr set/get : directory    [  OK  ]
 test21s : XATTR: simple xattr set/get : symlink      [  OK  ]
 test22f : XATTR: xattr creation/deletion : file      [  OK  ]
 test22d : XATTR: xattr creation/deletion : directory [  OK  ]
 test22s : XATTR: xattr creation/deletion : symlink   [  OK  ]
 test23f : XATTR: mulitple sets + 1 check : file      [  OK  ]
 test23d : XATTR: mulitple sets + 1 check : directory [  OK  ]
 test23s : XATTR: mulitple sets + 1 check : symlink   [  OK  ]
 All tests passed (20 successful, 0 skipped)

You can restrict t a subset of the tests by setting the ONLY variable.

 # ONLY=1,3,4s ./sigmund.sh ext4 -q
 test1m :  ALLFS: copy file with 444 mode             [  OK  ]
 test1g :  ALLFS: traverse 700 dirs with altgroups    [  OK  ]
 test3b :  ALLFS: cthon04's basic tests               [  OK  ]
 test3g :  ALLFS: cthon04's general tests             [  OK  ]
 test3s :  ALLFS: cthon04's special tests             [  OK  ]
 test3l :  ALLFS: cthon04's lock tests                [  OK  ]
 test4s :  ALLFS: Tar calls utimes on symlink         [  OK  ]
 All tests passed (7 successful, 0 skipped)

The EXCLUDE variable can be used to selct tests as well. EXCLUDE is kind of "negative ONLY".
Tests listed in EXCLUDE won't be run.

Example : do not run test2 and test4w

 # EXCLUDE=2,4w  ./sigmund.sh ext4 -q
 test1m :  ALLFS: copy file with 444 mode             [  OK  ]
 test1g :  ALLFS: traverse 700 dirs with altgroups    [  OK  ]
 test3b :  ALLFS: cthon04's basic tests               [  OK  ]
 test3g :  ALLFS: cthon04's general tests             [  OK  ]
 test3s :  ALLFS: cthon04's special tests             [  OK  ]
 test3l :  ALLFS: cthon04's lock tests                [  OK  ]
 test4g :  ALLFS: git clone a local repository        [  OK  ]
 test4s :  ALLFS: Tar calls utimes on symlink         [  OK  ]
 test4r :  ALLFS: Use mmap() to read a file           [  OK  ]

 test22f : XATTR: xattr creation/deletion : file      [  OK  ]
 test22d : XATTR: xattr creation/deletion : directory [  OK  ]
 test22s : XATTR: xattr creation/deletion : symlink   [  OK  ]
